Welcome to my new markdown page! This will detail my Day 2 notes, regarding Git, Github, VCS, and Visual Studio.

-----------------------------

Try and make multiple commits on Github, instead of just 1 large one.

Git and Github are much more efficient ways of distributing, updating, and revamping projects and code.
Version Control System is a way to manage files and directories, which can track changes over time and shows previous versions. 
Source Control is a subset of VCS.
It allows for groups to split off and work independently, then push changes and files to merge together, and then come for testing. Also allows for reverting, if something goes horribly wrong.


Git is cross platform, open source, free.  Over 90% of companies use Git for Version Controls (as of 2018).
No central server to need to connect to, and can work without internet.
Every copy of Git repo can serve either as the server or the client.
Tracks complete history of changes, not just versions.


Repos can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, etc.


Branching
Base line: Get the project to a basic level, with databases, folders, general structures. You’re able to take a copy of the base line, and no one can change it, except for one person.
Branching helps manage workflow of multiple ideas at once. If they don’t work, you can delete the branch, without destroying base line of the project.
Branches of branches allow for new base lines for potential enhancements, which can then be merged up the levels.

Main branch is used for the pushed product. Development should be for testing purposes, used to push to the main branch, after all is tested.
You want the main branch to have the least pull and push.
Dev branch should have all the branches / forks.
As soon as you merge into main, you MUST rebranch the dev branch, so it has the updated code.

“Pushing” the code is also called a commit. Notes in the commit are used for changelog notes!!!
Pull request is a discussion for code review, and is a request for your code to be pushed to the higher branch.
NOTE: For CSCI 2910, any help regarding code MUST be in the form of a pull request. This ensures access to your code from the main machine.
If there are merge conflicts, it allows you to choose what code to use, and such.

Code Cleanup is only available for C#

Refactoring is updating the code to maintain and understand easier, without breaking the code.
IntelliSense is a great code-completion and error aid.
Code snippets will aid to construct by prebuilding everything for you.
